# Change Log:

## 1.0.2

- Fixing the progress bar on the embed to normalize to 90% rather than 100%.  This is because Unity seemingly loads up to 90% progress, before attempting to start the game project, presumably to run all the scripts Awak() and Start() functions.

## 1.0.1

- Update [README.md](/README.md) instructions.
- Update [Documentation](/Documentation~/EmbedWebGLTemplate.md).

## 1.0.0

- Initial release.
