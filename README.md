# [Omiya Games](https://www.omiyagames.com/) - Template Unity Package

[![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/I3I51KS8F)

**Template Unity Package** is a Github template for starting a new Unity package.  A tutorial on how to utilize this template is described on [Taro Omiya's](https://github.com/japtar10101) blog: [*How to Split Up an Existing Unity Git Project into Smaller Unity Packages*](https://www.taroomiya.com/2020/04/04/how-to-split-up-an-existing-unity-git-project-into-smaller-unity-packages/).

## Install

In theory, can be installed with Unity's own Package Manager with the Github URL.

Since this package is just an example, it's not supported on [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/).  If it was, however, one would install this package by install OpenUPM with Node.js' `npm`:
```
npm install -g openupm-cli
```
After the command line tool is installed, just run:
```
openupm add com.omiyagames.template
```

## Documentation
